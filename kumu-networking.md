# Setting up a Kumu.io network

Kumu.io is network analysis software built a little like TimeMapper, designed to pull together resources and organize them to be shared on the web. 
The difference is that this is *network analysis* software, which involves helping to visually organize *connecting relationships or interactions* between distinct *nodes*. 
To work with Kumu.io, you set up a free account, and you can work with a Google Sheet to organize data for import. That is what we will be doing.

1) Begin by creating an account: 
2) Then, copy [my starter Kumu template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lV4rAvh-LyLYF0fC1TSGdPMbELpE3bLjF8EVOCVkZuU/edit?usp=sharing) to your Google Drive space. Here are Kumu's instructions:

```
    * Click the "Share" button in the upper right
    * Click "Get shareable link"
    * Set the permissions to "On - public on the web (Anyone on the internet can find and access. No sign-in required.)"
    * Copy the shareable link URL, and go back to your Kumu map
    * Click the green  button, select Import, and click the "Google Sheets" tab
    * Paste your Google Sheets link into the box under Link to public Google Sheet
```
