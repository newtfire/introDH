# Setting up a Kumu.io network

Kumu.io is network analysis software built a little like TimeMapper, designed to pull together resources and organize them to be shared on the web. 
The difference is that this is *network analysis* software, which involves helping to visually organize *connecting relationships or interactions* between distinct *nodes*.
