It is a “white” term in this context; it is a term of the white colonization of Australia. To call it a “white phrase” is not racism; it is an accurate representation of how the phrase is used for the purposes of the Australian government.

 Saturn Devouring His Son
What can I say about the fact that I remember every single beating I received as a child, that my instinctive aversion to conflict is a learned response, that I have an intense and confusing relationship with open water, a complicated relationship with my masculinity, with sex, a fear of dark and deep woods, a fear of living too long, a fear of roads that never end, of people who seem to disregard norms and limitations, of things too far from the ordinary, of loving, of being loved, of loss, of causing others harm, of hurting others inadvertently, of replying to long emails, of answering the phone at night, of being aware at every point in telling and retelling sanitised versions of events that it’s almost as if I’m telling someone else’s story altogether. In these circumstances and in many others, silence is a slow-acting poison but so is the truth.
Some years ago, I fell off my bike and fractured my ankle. The pain was severe, and it took many weeks before I was able to walk again. The injury is long healed now, but the shadow of it remains, such that the way I move about the world is a little more hesitant, my footing a little more careful.
Google shows me that I am a creature of habit. I return to the same places over and over again; a thick red line made up of countless red lines traces the path of the buses and car journeys; to the beach on the occasional weekend; to the pub more often; to work and back every weekday.

In moving toward UNIX from MULTICS, programmers conceptualized UNIX as a kind of tool kit of “synergistic parts” that allowed “flexibility in depth” (Raymond, 9). Programmers could “choose among multiple shells…. [and] programs normally provide[d] many behavior options”

While UNIX and C devotees will bemoan the nonorthogonality and leakiness of Windows or rant about the complexity of C++
The lack of intellectual generosity across our fields and departments only reinforces the divide-and-conquer mentality that the most dangerous aspects of modularity underwrite. 
In fact, the urban center of Detroit was more segregated by the 1980s than in previous decades, reflecting a different inflection of the programmer’s vision of the “easy removal” or containment of a troubling part. 
The ridged coating on 3-D postcards is actually a lenticular lens, a structural device that makes simultaneously viewing the various images contained on one card nearly impossible. The viewer can rotate the card to see any single image, but the lens itself makes seeing the images together very difficult, even as it conjoins them at a structural level (i.e., within the same card).

Much of the work in the digital humanities also proceeded as if technologies from XML to databases were neutral tools.6 Many who had worked hard to instill race as a central mode of analysis in film, literary, and media studies throughout the late twentieth century were disheartened and outraged (if not that surprised) to find both new media theory and emerging digital tools seem indifferent to those hard-won gains.
UNIX can also be thought of as more than an operating system, as it also includes a number of utilities such as command line editors, APIs, code libraries, and so on. Furthermore, UNIX is widely understood to embody particular philosophies and cultures of computation, “operating systems” of a larger order that we will return to.

Let me be clear. By drawing analogies between shifting racial and political formations and the emerging structures of digital computing in the late 1960s, I am not arguing that the programmers creating UNIX at Bell Labs and in Berkeley were consciously encoding new modes of racism and racial understanding into digital systems.

He recognizes that university departments (his example is English) begin to operate by a field-based and modular strategy of “coverage,” in which subfields proliferate and exist in their own separate chunks of knowledge, rarely contaminated by one another’s “internals” (250). (He also comments that this modular strategy includes the token hiring of scholars of color who are then cordoned off within the department.
In the post–civil rights United States, the lenticular is a way of organizing the world. It structures representations but also epistemologies. It also serves to secure our understandings of race in very narrow registers, fixating on sameness or difference while forestalling connection and interrelation.
We might contrast the lenticular postcard to that wildly popular artifact of the industrial era, the stereoscope card. The stereoscope melds two different images into an imagined whole, privileging the whole; the lenticular image partitions and divides, privileging fragmentation. 
“race-blind” rhetoric
In a hallway chat following our workshop, one scholar framed his dis-ease as a question: “Why are the digital humanities, well, so white?” And while my memory is far from perfect, I think it is safe to say that the Baltimore workshop included no discussion of many topics much in evidence at ASA, topics including immigration, race, and neoliberalism. To be fair, this was a workshop focused on the notion of tools and infrastructure, so one might not expect such discussions. Nonetheless, this essay will argue that we desperately need to close the gap between these two modes of inquiry. 
Maryland Institute for Technology

In mid-October 2008, the American Studies Association (ASA) hosted its annual conference in Albuquerque, New Mexico. According to its website, the ASA “is the nation’s oldest and largest association devoted to the interdisciplinary study of American culture and history.” Over the past two decades, the ASA conference has emerged as a leading venue for vibrant discussions about race, ethnicity, transnationalism, gender, and sexuality. While the ASA represents scholars with a diverse array of methodological approaches from a variety of disciplines, the society is a welcome home to academics whose work is interpretative and theoretical. During the meeting, I attended a variety of panels engaging such issues and approaches and came away feeling energized and refreshed, my intellectual imagination stoked by the many ways in which race and ethnicity were wielded as central terms of analysis throughout the long weekend.The following week, I was off to Baltimore where I attended “Tools for Data-Driven Scholarship,” a workshop funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services. This invitation-only event was cohosted by George Mason University’s Center for History and New Media (CHNM) and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH), two pioneering centers of what we have recently begun to call the “digital humanities.” This workshop built upon several years’ conversation (particularly following the 2003 NSF Atkins Report on cyberinfrastructure) about the need for a digital infrastructure for humanities computing.

In the long run, simply coping with these tensions will not address underlying problems. Instead, we need to design gathering tools with different goals in mind. 
We often break up into smaller groups in our gatherings for different activities and further discussion. When I'm participating in a physical gathering, the process of breaking out into these groups involves physically getting up and moving around, which shifts the energy of the group.
But it's not just the loss of irreplaceable in-person experiences that blocks us. Most of my communities use Zoom, as it's been the most reliable group videoconferencing tool thus far. 
To end group sessions, the host closes all the rooms. There is a 60 second countdown before all guests are booted back into the main room. Sometimes a participant is finishing their sentence as they are teleported back into the main room. Presumably the countdown is designed to help us stay on schedule. And we do stay on schedule, as the system relentlessly pushes us forward, cutting off our words, and hewing to its schedule-maintaining monomania.
or if we could drag a virtual “mic” around to signal who has the floor?
I'm a soft-spoken person. A frequent response to things I say is, "What?" In other words, it's hard for folks to hear me. However, in Zoom land, I've realized that I almost never have to repeat myself; people's voices are more equalized in these remote gatherings than they are in person. This also means the experience can be more accessible to people with difficulty hearing; they can turn up the volume to their desired needs.
Online, however, trainees describe that they feel less agency and less satisfaction in their online gathering experiences. Facilitators have less of a read that goals are being met; though all the points are touched upon and information is shared, the training feels quite rote. We leave with little of the spiritual, physical, and emotional connection that previously empowered us in our in-person gatherings. 
For participants, this can feel jarring. It generates an abrupt shift, denying them time to orient or finish up conversations.
On top of that, we must manage "raised hands", chat windows, and participant "reactions," juggling multiple control panel windows with limited screen real estate.

The only communication tools between breakout rooms are one-directional.
A host (and there can be only one) can force people into showing their video or hiding them away; a host can mute or unmute any user at will. 
 When I send a message to everyone, it’s akin to broadcasting an announcement over an intercom; I can announce how much time folks have left in their groups, but I can’t ask if they need more time to finish discussions. Participants cannot directly respond.
I can announce how much time folks have left in their groups, but I can’t ask if they need more time to finish discussions.
In a physical gathering, simply walking over to a group gently cues my arrival, but in Zoom, there are no such low-bandwidth signals.
In Zoom land, as a host I feel like I’m puppeteering the participants into their breakout rooms; “opening” the rooms feels like opening trap doors for everyone to fall into their assigned group and seat
There are new struggles that the software presents.
It’s hard for a facilitator to get a sense of how participants are doing,
In the hierarchy, there are hosts, co-hosts, and guests. This simple division of users leads to a huge imbalance in power.

Zoom has created a virtual building; it, too, shapes the way we interact with each other, constraining and nudging us in certain directions.
Much like bringing students from potentially chaotic home environments into (hopefully) pleasant classroom environments
At this point in an in-person session, I’d take a quick breather, and then scan the room to see how the groups are doing. I might pick up vibes of frustration from one group and come over to that table to help decompress. Then another table would burst out in laughter, and I’d bring up these positive emotions in the post-breakout debrief.
Zoom’s hierarchy
In Zoom land, it feels like the participants are meeting behind closed walls, as the facilitators twiddle their thumbs in the main room.
It can be hard for participants to engage in learning when the system forces a hierarchical, top-down learning style onto students

Why not create an atmosphere of trust by granting all participants equal access to the affordances of a host, and have participants look out for each other and provide collective moderation?
rote
Verbal communication takes precedence in Zoom, written communication follows, and non-verbal physically enacted communication is almost absent
Participant feedback I've received has indicated much higher standards for their digital learning experiences, wanting the content to be more engaging and smooth. Facilitators are forced into the role of the entertainer, working to retain the group's attention.
 there are no such low-bandwidth signals
Ideally, we all would be able to design tools for our communities that reflect our values, together.
During one session, we wanted to make breakout rooms that all people could move in and out of, so we made all the participants co-hosts.
We need to build with equity in mind first. And this is not just about Zoom. I invite you to question the other tools you use (with aids like the mini-zine) and see how they align with the values you want to uphold.
My co-facilitators often write off these struggles by faulting themselves, apologizing for the technical difficulties by confessing, “I’m not very Zoom literate.”

 Gathering has turned into a passive event centered around consumption.
 Reliability does not equate to a smooth experience, however.

monomania
For participants, this can feel jarring. It generates an abrupt shift, denying them time to orient or finish up conversations.
Unlike physical architecture, where we can set up temporary structures or invite people to decorate the room to change the tone of the space, our ability to control the way we’d like to meet virtually is even harder to change, because changing the architecture would require re-programming the software.
There are the obvious limitations of meeting virtually: body language is harder to check, it’s difficult to read the general vibe of the session, and peripheral cues (like looking over your shoulder or across the room to see what your peers are up to) are absent.
egalitarian
At the root of these problems are the patriarchal, capitalist systems we’re entrenched in, marginalizing folks and leaving out ways of gathering not celebrated by these systems.
It’s the way the software has been designed, and the assumptions the software makes about the goals of your communication.
Facilitators have less of a read that goals are being met; though all the points are touched upon and information is shared, the training feels quite rote. We leave with little of the spiritual, physical, and emotional connection that previously empowered us in our in-person gatherings.

One might make a similar claim about humanities scholars who resist the lure of humanities computing and DH.

Such a focus threatens the culture, economy, and social identity of humanities researchers.

Kevin Kelly
In an essay that has come to define the Arts and Crafts Movement, William Morris (1884) suggests that “a man at work, making something which he feels will exist because he is working at it and wills it, is exercising the energies of his mind and soul as well as of his body.”
Several champions of the maker movement, including Kevin Kelly, Mark Hatch (2014), and Chris Anderson (2012), assert the same claim. In Makers: The New Industrial Revolution, Anderson suggests that “digital natives are starting to hunger for life beyond the screen” (18).
Even Arduino, which started as a loosely organized, non-commercial, open-source microcontroller platform shared by communities of makers, was scarred by secretive copyrighting, corporate greed, and an international brand war
Although Kittler does not make the connection explicit, his tinkering cannot be separated from his archaeological media theories. I am calling for a version of DH that makes the connection explicit, and does so to provide modes of digital production that are not complicit with technocapitalism and also resist appeals to progress for the sake of progress.
Stephen Ramsay, however, when he suggested at the 2011 Modern Language Association convention that “Digital Humanities is about building things” (“Who’s In and Who’s Out”).
Rather than picking up the sledgehammer, DH neo-Luddites might emulate the habits of Friedrich Kittler (1996): “At night, after I had finished writing, I would pick up the soldering iron and build circuits” (in Griffin 731).

DH neo-Luddites do not abandon scholarly writing; they supplement it by creating critical objects-to-think-with that provide alternative models for digital media production — models that do not respond dutifully to the demands for efficiency and commercialization that characterize prevailing conceptions of “innovation.”

Algorithms don’t require computers any more than geometry does. An algorithm solves a problem, and a great algorithm gets a name. Dijkstra’s algorithm, after the famed computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra, finds the shortest path in a graph. By the way, “graph” here doesn’t mean but rather . Think of a map; streets connect to streets at intersections. It’s a graph! There are graphs all around you. Plumbing, electricity, code compilation, social networks, the Internet, all can be represented as graphs! (Now to monetize …)
Some programming languages, such as C, will do their best to do exactly as you ask, even if that means crashing your computer. Others, like OCaml and Haskell, are very constrained and ask a programmer to hew to a narrow form, trying to steer you away from anything stupid.

Coding is a broad human activity, like sport, or writing. When software developers think of coding, most of them are thinking about lines of code in files. They’re handed a problem, think about the problem, write code that will solve the problem, and then expect the computer to turn word into deed.

The DRY principle, for Don’t Repeat Yourself, is one of the colloquial tenets of programming. That is, you should name things once, do things once, create a function once, and let the computer repeat itself.

Don’t ever count Microsoft out. Its great corporate skill has always been to take the sheer weirdness of computer ideas and translate them for corporations, in the language of Global Business Leadership. Whatever is discussed in this issue, Microsoft offers at least one of it. Statically typed, scripting, data-driven, functional—name your ambiguous adjective, and Microsoft will sell something that delivers that to you, and you can write Windows code in it and live a Windows life. And this is not disparagement; Microsoft products can be as good as or better than anything else on the market.
Data management is the problem that programming is supposed to solve.
But there’s another way to interpret all this activity around Python: People love it and want it to work everywhere and do everything. They’ve spent tens of thousands of hours making that possible and then given the fruit of their labor away. That’s a powerful indicator.

Fewer than a fifth of undergraduate degrees in computer science awarded in 2012 went to women, according to the National Center for Women & Information Technology. Less than 30 percent of the people in computing are women. And the number of women in computing has fallen since the 1980s, even as the market for their skills has expanded.
Women in software, having had enough, started to write it up, post to blogs. Other women did the same. The problem is pervasive: There are a lot of conferences, and there have been many reports of harassing behavior. The language Ruby, the preferred language for startup bros, developed the worst reputation. At a Ruby conference in 2009, someone gave a talk subtitled “Perform Like a Pr0n Star,” with sexy slides. That was dispiriting. There have been criminal incidents, too.

Expectations around software have changed over time. IBM unbundled software from hardware in the 1960s and got to charge more; Microsoft rebundled Internet Explorer with Windows in 1998 and got sued; Apple initially refused anyone else the ability to write software for the iPhone when it came out in 2007, and then opened the App Store, which expanded into a vast commercial territory—and soon the world had Angry Birds.

That’s roughly the population of the greater Los Angeles metro area. Imagine all of L.A. programming.

These locational data are shared with advertisers and utilised by data brokers to create user profiles.

It sells data ‘about its cell phone users’ “age range, gender and zip codes for where they live, work, shop and more” as well as information about mobile-device habits’ including URL visits, app downloads and usage, browsing trends and more’

 Active GPS tracking is commonly used in fleet management to track goods vehicles, public transport and hire cars, or to monitor cars on a payment plan to ensure that it can be traced and recovered in cases of default, or in private cars as a means of theft recovery. 
Such data reveals the movement of device owners between locations, revealing the sites of popular spots such as home, work, and where they shop. 
Location and movement can also be voluntarily shared by individuals through online calenders, most of which are private but nonetheless stored in the cloud, and some of which are shared openly or with colleagues.
New vehicles are routinely fitted with GPS that enables the on-board computers to track location, movement, and speed.
Likewise, smart phone apps can access and transfer such information and also share them to third parties.
There are an estimated 8,300 ANPR cameras across the UK capturing 30 million number plates each day (15).

 Saturn Devouring His Son
What can I say about the fact that I remember every single beating I received as a child, that my instinctive aversion to conflict is a learned response, that I have an intense and confusing relationship with open water, a complicated relationship with my masculinity, with sex, a fear of dark and deep woods, a fear of living too long, a fear of roads that never end, of people who seem to disregard norms and limitations, of things too far from the ordinary, of loving, of being loved, of loss, of causing others harm, of hurting others inadvertently, of replying to long emails, of answering the phone at night, of being aware at every point in telling and retelling sanitised versions of events that it’s almost as if I’m telling someone else’s story altogether. In these circumstances and in many others, silence is a slow-acting poison but so is the truth.
Some years ago, I fell off my bike and fractured my ankle. The pain was severe, and it took many weeks before I was able to walk again. The injury is long healed now, but the shadow of it remains, such that the way I move about the world is a little more hesitant, my footing a little more careful.

In fact, the urban center of Detroit was more segregated by the 1980s than in previous decades, reflecting a different inflection of the programmer’s vision of the “easy removal” or containment of a troubling part. 
The ridged coating on 3-D postcards is actually a lenticular lens, a structural device that makes simultaneously viewing the various images contained on one card nearly impossible. The viewer can rotate the card to see any single image, but the lens itself makes seeing the images together very difficult, even as it conjoins them at a structural level (i.e., within the same card).

Much of the work in the digital humanities also proceeded as if technologies from XML to databases were neutral tools.6 Many who had worked hard to instill race as a central mode of analysis in film, literary, and media studies throughout the late twentieth century were disheartened and outraged (if not that surprised) to find both new media theory and emerging digital tools seem indifferent to those hard-won gains.
UNIX can also be thought of as more than an operating system, as it also includes a number of utilities such as command line editors, APIs, code libraries, and so on. Furthermore, UNIX is widely understood to embody particular philosophies and cultures of computation, “operating systems” of a larger order that we will return to.

Let me be clear. By drawing analogies between shifting racial and political formations and the emerging structures of digital computing in the late 1960s, I am not arguing that the programmers creating UNIX at Bell Labs and in Berkeley were consciously encoding new modes of racism and racial understanding into digital systems.

He recognizes that university departments (his example is English) begin to operate by a field-based and modular strategy of “coverage,” in which subfields proliferate and exist in their own separate chunks of knowledge, rarely contaminated by one another’s “internals” (250). (He also comments that this modular strategy includes the token hiring of scholars of color who are then cordoned off within the department.
In the post–civil rights United States, the lenticular is a way of organizing the world. It structures representations but also epistemologies. It also serves to secure our understandings of race in very narrow registers, fixating on sameness or difference while forestalling connection and interrelation.
We might contrast the lenticular postcard to that wildly popular artifact of the industrial era, the stereoscope card. The stereoscope melds two different images into an imagined whole, privileging the whole; the lenticular image partitions and divides, privileging fragmentation. 
“race-blind” rhetoric
In a hallway chat following our workshop, one scholar framed his dis-ease as a question: “Why are the digital humanities, well, so white?” And while my memory is far from perfect, I think it is safe to say that the Baltimore workshop included no discussion of many topics much in evidence at ASA, topics including immigration, race, and neoliberalism. To be fair, this was a workshop focused on the notion of tools and infrastructure, so one might not expect such discussions. Nonetheless, this essay will argue that we desperately need to close the gap between these two modes of inquiry. 
Maryland Institute for Technology

In mid-October 2008, the American Studies Association (ASA) hosted its annual conference in Albuquerque, New Mexico. According to its website, the ASA “is the nation’s oldest and largest association devoted to the interdisciplinary study of American culture and history.” Over the past two decades, the ASA conference has emerged as a leading venue for vibrant discussions about race, ethnicity, transnationalism, gender, and sexuality. While the ASA represents scholars with a diverse array of methodological approaches from a variety of disciplines, the society is a welcome home to academics whose work is interpretative and theoretical. During the meeting, I attended a variety of panels engaging such issues and approaches and came away feeling energized and refreshed, my intellectual imagination stoked by the many ways in which race and ethnicity were wielded as central terms of analysis throughout the long weekend.The following week, I was off to Baltimore where I attended “Tools for Data-Driven Scholarship,” a workshop funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the Institute of Museum and Library Services. This invitation-only event was cohosted by George Mason University’s Center for History and New Media (CHNM) and the Maryland Institute for Technology in the Humanities (MITH), two pioneering centers of what we have recently begun to call the “digital humanities.” This workshop built upon several years’ conversation (particularly following the 2003 NSF Atkins Report on cyberinfrastructure) about the need for a digital infrastructure for humanities computing.

We often break up into smaller groups in our gatherings for different activities and further discussion. When I'm participating in a physical gathering, the process of breaking out into these groups involves physically getting up and moving around, which shifts the energy of the group.
But it's not just the loss of irreplaceable in-person experiences that blocks us. Most of my communities use Zoom, as it's been the most reliable group videoconferencing tool thus far. 
To end group sessions, the host closes all the rooms. There is a 60 second countdown before all guests are booted back into the main room. Sometimes a participant is finishing their sentence as they are teleported back into the main room. Presumably the countdown is designed to help us stay on schedule. And we do stay on schedule, as the system relentlessly pushes us forward, cutting off our words, and hewing to its schedule-maintaining monomania.
or if we could drag a virtual “mic” around to signal who has the floor?
I'm a soft-spoken person. A frequent response to things I say is, "What?" In other words, it's hard for folks to hear me. However, in Zoom land, I've realized that I almost never have to repeat myself; people's voices are more equalized in these remote gatherings than they are in person. This also means the experience can be more accessible to people with difficulty hearing; they can turn up the volume to their desired needs.
Online, however, trainees describe that they feel less agency and less satisfaction in their online gathering experiences. Facilitators have less of a read that goals are being met; though all the points are touched upon and information is shared, the training feels quite rote. We leave with little of the spiritual, physical, and emotional connection that previously empowered us in our in-person gatherings. 
For participants, this can feel jarring. It generates an abrupt shift, denying them time to orient or finish up conversations.
On top of that, we must manage "raised hands", chat windows, and participant "reactions," juggling multiple control panel windows with limited screen real estate.

 During one session, we wanted to make breakout rooms that all people could move in and out of, so we made all the participants co-hosts.
vacuum of consent
The only communication tools between breakout rooms are one-directional.
A host (and there can be only one) can force people into showing their video or hiding them away; a host can mute or unmute any user at will. 
 When I send a message to everyone, it’s akin to broadcasting an announcement over an intercom; I can announce how much time folks have left in their groups, but I can’t ask if they need more time to finish discussions. Participants cannot directly respond.
I can announce how much time folks have left in their groups, but I can’t ask if they need more time to finish discussions.
In a physical gathering, simply walking over to a group gently cues my arrival, but in Zoom, there are no such low-bandwidth signals.
In Zoom land, as a host I feel like I’m puppeteering the participants into their breakout rooms; “opening” the rooms feels like opening trap doors for everyone to fall into their assigned group and seat
There are new struggles that the software presents.
It’s hard for a facilitator to get a sense of how participants are doing,
In the hierarchy, there are hosts, co-hosts, and guests. This simple division of users leads to a huge imbalance in power.
inequitable
Zoom has created a virtual building; it, too, shapes the way we interact with each other, constraining and nudging us in certain directions.
Much like bringing students from potentially chaotic home environments into (hopefully) pleasant classroom environments
At this point in an in-person session, I’d take a quick breather, and then scan the room to see how the groups are doing. I might pick up vibes of frustration from one group and come over to that table to help decompress. Then another table would burst out in laughter, and I’d bring up these positive emotions in the post-breakout debrief.
Zoom’s hierarchy
In Zoom land, it feels like the participants are meeting behind closed walls, as the facilitators twiddle their thumbs in the main room.
It can be hard for participants to engage in learning when the system forces a hierarchical, top-down learning style onto students
remote gathering tools
Why not create an atmosphere of trust by granting all participants equal access to the affordances of a host, and have participants look out for each other and provide collective moderation?
rote
Verbal communication takes precedence in Zoom, written communication follows, and non-verbal physically enacted communication is almost absent
Participant feedback I've received has indicated much higher standards for their digital learning experiences, wanting the content to be more engaging and smooth. Facilitators are forced into the role of the entertainer, working to retain the group's attention.
 there are no such low-bandwidth signals
Ideally, we all would be able to design tools for our communities that reflect our values, together.
During one session, we wanted to make breakout rooms that all people could move in and out of, so we made all the participants co-hosts.
We need to build with equity in mind first. And this is not just about Zoom. I invite you to question the other tools you use (with aids like the mini-zine) and see how they align with the values you want to uphold.
My co-facilitators often write off these struggles by faulting themselves, apologizing for the technical difficulties by confessing, “I’m not very Zoom literate.”
it feels intrusive to pop in to a breakout room.
We are forced into Zoom’s hierarchy of “host”, “co-hosts”, and “guests”, when our ideal gathering calls for “facilitators” and “active participants

 Gathering has turned into a passive event centered around consumption.
 Reliability does not equate to a smooth experience, however.

monomania
For participants, this can feel jarring. It generates an abrupt shift, denying them time to orient or finish up conversations.
Unlike physical architecture, where we can set up temporary structures or invite people to decorate the room to change the tone of the space, our ability to control the way we’d like to meet virtually is even harder to change, because changing the architecture would require re-programming the software.
There are the obvious limitations of meeting virtually: body language is harder to check, it’s difficult to read the general vibe of the session, and peripheral cues (like looking over your shoulder or across the room to see what your peers are up to) are absent.
egalitarian
At the root of these problems are the patriarchal, capitalist systems we’re entrenched in, marginalizing folks and leaving out ways of gathering not celebrated by these systems.
It’s the way the software has been designed, and the assumptions the software makes about the goals of your communication.
Facilitators have less of a read that goals are being met; though all the points are touched upon and information is shared, the training feels quite rote. We leave with little of the spiritual, physical, and emotional connection that previously empowered us in our in-person gatherings.

One might make a similar claim about humanities scholars who resist the lure of humanities computing and DH. For them, the problem with DH is not its technophilia, but its focus on making tools for the sake of making tools. Such a focus threatens the culture, economy, and social identity of humanities researchers.

DH neo-Luddism, like DH more generally, need not be defined as building digital tools. DH might thrive just as well on the creation of analog objects such as homemade radios, conductive play dough, and even media theory essays — as long as these objects-to-think-with are created in the context of digital culture,
Kevin Kelly
In an essay that has come to define the Arts and Crafts Movement, William Morris (1884) suggests that “a man at work, making something which he feels will exist because he is working at it and wills it, is exercising the energies of his mind and soul as well as of his body.”
Several champions of the maker movement, including Kevin Kelly, Mark Hatch (2014), and Chris Anderson (2012), assert the same claim. In Makers: The New Industrial Revolution, Anderson suggests that “digital natives are starting to hunger for life beyond the screen” (18).
Even Arduino, which started as a loosely organized, non-commercial, open-source microcontroller platform shared by communities of makers, was scarred by secretive copyrighting, corporate greed, and an international brand war
Although Kittler does not make the connection explicit, his tinkering cannot be separated from his archaeological media theories. I am calling for a version of DH that makes the connection explicit, and does so to provide modes of digital production that are not complicit with technocapitalism and also resist appeals to progress for the sake of progress.
Stephen Ramsay, however, when he suggested at the 2011 Modern Language Association convention that “Digital Humanities is about building things” (“Who’s In and Who’s Out”).
Rather than picking up the sledgehammer, DH neo-Luddites might emulate the habits of Friedrich Kittler (1996): “At night, after I had finished writing, I would pick up the soldering iron and build circuits” (in Griffin 731).
Marcel O’Gorman
a make-oriented approach to scholarship
DH neo-Luddites do not abandon scholarly writing; they supplement it by creating critical objects-to-think-with that provide alternative models for digital media production — models that do not respond dutifully to the demands for efficiency and commercialization that characterize prevailing conceptions of “innovation.”

Algorithms don’t require computers any more than geometry does. An algorithm solves a problem, and a great algorithm gets a name. Dijkstra’s algorithm, after the famed computer scientist Edsger Dijkstra, finds the shortest path in a graph. By the way, “graph” here doesn’t mean but rather . Think of a map; streets connect to streets at intersections. It’s a graph! There are graphs all around you. Plumbing, electricity, code compilation, social networks, the Internet, all can be represented as graphs! (Now to monetize …)
Some programming languages, such as C, will do their best to do exactly as you ask, even if that means crashing your computer. Others, like OCaml and Haskell, are very constrained and ask a programmer to hew to a narrow form, trying to steer you away from anything stupid.

 Active GPS tracking is commonly used in fleet management to track goods vehicles, public transport and hire cars, or to monitor cars on a payment plan to ensure that it can be traced and recovered in cases of default, or in private cars as a means of theft recovery. 
Such data reveals the movement of device owners between locations, revealing the sites of popular spots such as home, work, and where they shop. 
Location and movement can also be voluntarily shared by individuals through online calenders, most of which are private but nonetheless stored in the cloud, and some of which are shared openly or with colleagues.
New vehicles are routinely fitted with GPS that enables the on-board computers to track location, movement, and speed.
